There are hundreds of apps, including Google Now, that notify you of dues and dates. But there is yet to be a Service that actually executes the payment when you tell it to, without having to go to different sites.

                                                        One of the first things we get asked a lot is what is different about us from Bill Junction or Instamojo. Its simple. We aren't a gateway for recurring payments. Merchants ask customers for money through Allopay, if the user wants, we make the transfer.

                                                        Payment gateways were always a hassle. Wallets came a long way in improving things. But wallets are simply an unnecessary step in giveing money to merchants. Allopay follows the tradition ask and give policy.
